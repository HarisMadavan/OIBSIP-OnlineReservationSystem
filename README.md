Online Reservation System
This is a simple command-line-based Online Reservation System implemented in Java. The system allows users to register, log in, make reservations, and cancel reservations. The project is designed to be modular, using basic Java constructs like HashMap to store user and reservation data.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
Make a Reservation: After logging in, users can create a new reservation.
Cancel a Reservation: Users can cancel an existing reservation if they have one.
Logout: Users can log out of the system and return to the main menu.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

OnlineReservationSystem: The main class that handles the entire workflow of the application.
Users and Reservations: Stored in HashMap collections where usernames and passwords are paired, and reservations are linked to users.
Input Handling: Managed using Java's Scanner class to interact with the user via the console.
